  "outline": "## Introduction\nHave you ever tried to visit a website, only to find that it doesn't load, and you get a message saying \"server not found\"? This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes in. DNS is a crucial technology that helps us access websites and online services by translating easy-to-remember domain names into the actual IP addresses that computers can understand.\n\n## Main Concepts\n1. **What is DNS?**\n\t* Definition: a system that maps domain names to IP addresses\n\t* Purpose: enables users to access websites and online services using easy-to-remember domain names\n2. **How DNS Works**\n\t* Recursive vs. Iterative query process\n\t* Role of DNS resolvers and name servers\n\t* Example: user types in a URL, and the DNS process unfolds\n3. **DNS Resolution Process**\n\t* Step-by-step explanation of how a DNS query is resolved\n\t* Visualizing the DNS hierarchy (root, top-level domains, subdomains)\n4. **Common DNS Terms**\n\t* IP addresses\n\t* DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, etc.)\n\t* DNS caching and propagation\n\n## Flow\n1. Introduction (5 seconds)\n2. What is DNS? (15 seconds)\n\t* Visuals: animation of a user typing a URL\n\t* Animation: simple diagram of DNS system\n3. How DNS Works (30 seconds)\n\t* Visuals: animation of recursive vs. iterative query process\n\t* Animation: diagram of DNS resolver and name server interaction\n4. DNS Resolution Process (30 seconds)\n\t* Visuals: animation of step-by-step DNS query resolution\n\t* Animation: visual representation of DNS hierarchy\n5. Common DNS Terms (10 seconds)\n\t* Visuals: simple definitions and animations for IP addresses, DNS records, and DNS caching\n6. Conclusion (5 seconds)\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, DNS is a critical technology that enables us to access websites and online services using easy-to-remember domain names. Understanding how DNS works and the resolution process can help us appreciate the complexity and importance of this technology.",
